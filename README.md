## How it's going

START:1

First app.py Flask environment

I have updated the script by adding a new feature, an '/about' route that renders a paragraph when accessed. I also improved the efficiency of the code by wrapping the HTML content in the `<html>` and `<body>` tags only once, at the beginning of the response. This enhances the clarity and maintainability of the code. Additionally, I've set the `debug` parameter to `True` in the `app.run()` function, which enables debug mode, making it easier for development and testing. These changes expand the functionality of the web application while simplifying and optimizing the HTML output.

I have enhanced the efficiency of your Flask web application by incorporating a new feature and making some improvements. 

Here's a concise description of the updates:
1. New Feature: I added a '/contact' route, which displays a 'Contact Us' page. It provides users with an email address for communication. 
2. Efficiency Improvement: To allow the application to be accessed from any network-connected device, I modified the `app.run()` function to specify the host as '0.0.0.0' and set the port to 5001. This ensures the app is accessible remotely. 
3. Debugging Ease: I enabled debug mode for a smoother development experience. This provides detailed error messages, aiding in troubleshooting. 

These changes introduce a contact page and enhance the application's accessibility and usability.
