## How it's going

START:1

First app.py Flask environment

I have updated the script by adding a new feature, an '/about' route that renders a paragraph when accessed. I also improved the efficiency of the code by wrapping the HTML content in the `<html>` and `<body>` tags only once, at the beginning of the response. This enhances the clarity and maintainability of the code. Additionally, I've set the `debug` parameter to `True` in the `app.run()` function, which enables debug mode, making it easier for development and testing. These changes expand the functionality of the web application while simplifying and optimizing the HTML output.
