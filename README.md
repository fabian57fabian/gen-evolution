## How it's going

START:1

First app.py Flask environment

END:1


START:2

I have updated the script by adding a new route `/greet` that greets a person by name. This feature uses the `request.args.get('name')` to retrieve the name parameter from the URL query string. If a name is provided, it returns a personalized greeting; otherwise, it prompts the user to provide a name. 

Additionally, the response format has been changed from HTML to JSON for the `/` route, returning a dictionary with a simple "Hello" and "World" greeting. 

These improvements make the script more versatile and functional, allowing for more interactive and dynamic behavior.

END:2

I have updated the code to include two new improvements:

1. I added a new endpoint `/greet` which supports both GET and POST methods. The endpoint personalizes the greeting based on the provided name parameter. The GET method uses the `request.args.get('name')` to retrieve the name from the URL query, while the POST method uses `request.form['name']` to obtain the name from the form data.

2. I also added appropriate HTTP status codes to the responses. The GET method returns a 200 OK status when a name is provided, and a 400 Bad Request status when the name parameter is missing. Similarly, the POST method returns 201 Created when a name is successfully posted, and 400 Bad Request when the name field is missing in the posted data.

These changes make the script more versatile and user-friendly, allowing for different ways of interacting with the application and providing clearer feedback on the success or failure of the requests.
